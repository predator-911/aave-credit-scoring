# Aave Credit Scoring Model

## ðŸš€ Goal
Assign credit scores (0â€“1000) to DeFi wallets based on their interaction behavior with the Aave V2 protocol using ML.

## ðŸ“ˆ Features Engineered
- Transaction frequency & type counts (deposit, borrow, repay, etc.)
- Total/avg amounts
- USD value estimations
- Repay-to-borrow ratios
- Liquidation rates
- Asset and protocol diversity

## ðŸ§  Model Used
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- RÂ²: 0.925
- Top features: `repay_to_borrow_ratio`, `total_usd_value`, `borrow_count`

## ðŸ§ª Scoring Strategy
Scores are scaled between 0â€“1000. Higher = responsible wallet. Lower = risky or bot-like.

## ðŸ“‚ Output Files
- `wallet_scores.csv`
- `feature_importance.csv`
- `comprehensive_analysis.png`

## ðŸ“Š Behavior Summary
- Excellent wallets: 57%
- Risky wallets (liquidated): 2.9%
- Low repay ratio: 21.6%
