## 1. Project Overview

This project presents a wallet risk scoring system designed to assess the risk profiles of Ethereum wallet addresses based on their historical transaction data on the **Compound V2 & V3 lending protocols**. 

The primary objective is to create a quantifiable, data-driven model that assigns each wallet a risk score between 0 and 1000, where a lower score indicates lower risk and a higher score indicates higher risk. This model analyzes on-chain behaviors to distinguish between safe, reliable users and those who exhibit high-risk leveraging or poor debt management.

The analysis was performed on a list of 100 wallet addresses provided for the assignment.

## 2. Methodology

Our approach is divided into three core stages: collecting the necessary on-chain data, engineering meaningful features that reflect financial behavior, and developing a weighted model to calculate the final risk score.

### 2.1. Data Collection

To ensure the analysis was focused strictly on the Compound protocol as required, we sourced data by tracking specific on-chain events associated with user lending and borrowing activities.

- **Data Source:** The Graph Protocol (Compound v2 Subgraph) and direct Ethereum node queries (via `web3.py`).
- **Protocol Events Tracked:**
  - `Mint`: Supplying assets to the protocol (collateral).
  - `Borrow`: Taking out a loan against collateral.
  - `RepayBorrow`: Making a repayment on an existing loan.
  - `LiquidateBorrow`: A third-party repaying a user's underwater loan and seizing their collateral. This is a critical risk indicator.
- **Data Points Collected:** For each transaction, we gathered details such as the asset involved, the amount, the USD equivalent at the time of the transaction, and the block timestamp.

### 2.2. Feature Engineering & Rationale

Raw transaction data was processed to engineer a set of features that serve as proxies for a wallet's financial health and risk appetite.

| Feature Name | Description & Rationale | Risk Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Liquidation Events** | A count of how many times the wallet has been partially or fully liquidated. **This is the most significant indicator of high-risk behavior**, as it demonstrates a failure to manage debt effectively. | **Very High** |
| **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio** | The ratio of the wallet's total borrowed value in USD to its total supplied collateral value in USD. A higher LTV means the user is more leveraged and closer to a liquidation threshold. | **High** |
| **Health Factor** | A representation of the safety of a user's position, calculated based on their collateral and debt. A factor below 1.0 is subject to liquidation. We analyze the wallet's average and current health factor. | **High** |
| **Borrow-to-Supply Ratio** | The ratio of total borrow events to total supply events. A user who borrows frequently relative to their supply actions may be using the protocol more aggressively. | **Medium** |
| **Collateral & Debt Diversity** | The number of unique assets the wallet has supplied as collateral and the number of unique assets it has borrowed. Over-reliance on a single, volatile asset for collateral is riskier than a diversified portfolio. | **Medium** |
| **Account Age & Activity** | The time since the wallet's first interaction with the Compound protocol and the total number of transactions. Older, more established accounts with a consistent history are generally less risky. | **Low** |
| **Repayment History** | A ratio of total repayment value to total borrow value. A history of successfully repaying large loans is a strong positive signal of reliability. | **Low** |

### 2.3. Risk Scoring Model

The final risk score is calculated using a weighted scoring model, which ensures that the most critical risk factors have the greatest impact on the outcome.

**Step 1: Normalization**
Each feature was normalized to a common scale (0 to 1) using the Min-Max normalization formula. This prevents features with large value ranges (like total borrowed USD) from disproportionately influencing the score over binary features (like liquidation events).

X_norm = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)


**Step 2: Weighted Sum**
We assigned a weight to each normalized feature based on its importance in determining risk. Features indicating negative behavior were given negative weights, while positive indicators received positive weights.

| Feature | Sample Weight |
| :--- | :---: |
| Liquidation Events | -40 |
| High LTV Ratio | -25 |
| Low Health Factor | -20 |
| Repayment History | +10 |
| Account Age | +5 |

The final raw score was computed as the weighted sum of all normalized features.

**Step 3: Final Score Scaling**
The resulting raw scores were scaled to the required **0 to 1000** range to produce the final risk score for each wallet.

## 7. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a systematic approach to on-chain risk assessment. By focusing on protocol-specific interactions and engineering features that capture nuanced financial behavior, we were able to build a robust model that effectively differentiates wallet risk profiles. The methodology is transparent, justified, and scalable for analyzing larger sets of addresses.
